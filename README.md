# PPOL-6819 Final Project: Predictive Modeling of County-level Crime Rate
This is Ziwen Lu, Xuyan Xiu, and Doris Yan's final project. Please click on [GitHub Pages](https://dorisyan1122.github.io/PPOL6819-Final-Project/) for details. 

Our project contains two parts: 

1. geospatial mapping of average crime rate from 2002 to 2014;
2. predictive modeling of 2010 crime rate on 2016 crime rate

Our models are robust to predict the unseen data. Applying our model of violent crime rate on the implementation data in 2016 generates RMSE of 0.593, which means the average difference between our model's predicted values and the actual values is 0.593. Similarly, for property crime rate, the average difference between our model's predicted values and the actual values is 0.459.
