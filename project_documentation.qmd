# Introduction

Crime is a significant concern in public policy since crime directly affects individual and community well-being. Crime also has a huge impact on the economy as it increases the costs of public safety measures and deters investment. The estimated annual cost of crime is \$4.71 - \$5.67 trillion including transfers and \$2.86 - \$3.92 trillion net of transfers in the United States. The two major crimes in the United States are violent crime, which includes homicide, rape, robbery, and aggravated, and property crime, which includes arson, burglary, and theft. According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, there were 5,049,721 property crimes and 809,381 violent crimes reported in the United States in 2022. Thus, we believe that it is important to understand the factors that predict crime and provide implications for policymakers to reduce crime and increase social stability.

Rudolph, and Ahern (2018) used a machine-learning approach to study the predictors of firearm violence in California. The community indicators they use include education, race inclusion, and poverty. With a similar machine-learning methodology to study crimes, we will expand their scope by (1) covering a wider variety of crimes that include both property and violent crimes, (2) using the entire United States Census Tract data instead of only the California data, and (3) focusing on the socioeconomic status factors as well as the community/urban planning factors that predict crime. Using the National Neighborhood Data Archive (NaNDA), we are able to gather data on crime, socioeconomic status, and urban planning features such as school counts, number of parks, street connectivity, urbanicity, land cover, road system, and pollution.

Steinberg et al. (2019) studied the impact of school closure in Philadelphia and found a significant decline in crime following school closure, mainly driven by the reduction in violent crime. Murray et al. (2010) also found that residence blocks with schools had a significantly higher number of felonious and motor vehicle thefts. Park also has a huge impact on crime. In the study by Groff and McCord (2012), they found a high density of violent, property, and disorder crime in the park environs, and the further away from the park environs, the lower the crime. In terms of traffic and land, Beland and Brent (2018) found a relationship between traffic congestion and domestic violence, extreme traffic increases the incidence of domestic violence by 9% in Los Angeles. There has also been extensive study on the relationship between air pollution and crime. Burkhardt et al. (2019) found a robust positive effect of increased air pollution on violent crimes in the United States. Their result suggested a 10% reduction in daily PM2.5 and ozone could save \$1.4 billion in crime costs per year. A similar result was found by Herrnstadt et al. (2016). They found a positive relationship between air pollution and violent crime in Chicago and Los Angeles.

# Method

Inspired by Rudolph and Ahern (2018) and previous studies, we use a machine-learning methodology to study crimes in the United States, using the urban planning predictors from the NaNDA. We use regularized regression models and tree-based models for model building and compare the predicted crime number with the actual crime number in the United States.
