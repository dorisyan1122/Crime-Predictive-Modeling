# Introduction

Crime is a significant concern in public policy since crime directly affects individual and community well-being. Crime also has a huge impact on the economy as it increases the costs of public safety measures and deters investment. The estimated annual cost of crime is \$4.71 - \$5.67 trillion [@anderson2021]. The two major types of crimes in the United States are violent crime (homicide, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault) and property crime (burglary, larceny, and auto theft). According to the Federal Bureau of Investigation, there were 5,049,721 property crimes and 809,381 violent crimes reported in the United States in 2022. Therefore, we believe that it is important to understand the factors that predict crime and lends insights to policies that reduce crime and increase social stability.

We are interested in learning about urban planning factors that predict crime rate. @goin2018 studied the predictors of firearm violence in California with a machine-learning approach. The covariates they use include ACS 5-year estimates of ZCTA-level community characteristics, alcohol outlet density, and climate. With a similar machine-learning methodology to study crimes, we will expand their scope by (1) covering a wider variety of crimes that include both property and violent crimes, (2) using county-level data from the entire U.S. (3) focusing on the socioeconomic status factors as well as the urban planning factors that predict crime.

Previous research support our choice of covariates. There is significant decline in crime following school closure in Philadelphia. The reduction in crime, mainly driven by the reduction in violent crime, is concentrated in places where high schools are closed [@steinberg2019]. Residential blocks with more schools have a significantly higher number of felonious and motor vehicle thefts (i.e., property crimes) [@murray2013]. Park also has a huge impact on crime in that there is high density of violent, property, and disorder crimes in the park.The further away from parks, the lower the crime [@groff2012]. In terms of traffic and land, there is significant relationship between traffic congestion and domestic violence. Extreme traffic increases the incidence of domestic violence by 9% in Los Angeles [@beland2018]. Environmental factors likewise have an effect on crime. Increased pollution has a positive effect on violent crimes in the United States. A 10% reduction in daily PM2.5 and ozone could save \$1.4 billion in crime costs per year [@burkhardt2019]. In contrast, the amount and access to green space in the urban environment has a mitigating impact on violent crime [@shepley2019]. The results are important for urban crime prevention, considering that there are more crimes in the cities than in rural areas, according to National Crime Victimization Survey in 2021.

# Method

Inspired by @goin2018, we use a machine-learning methodology to build a predictive model of crimes. Using the National Neighborhood Data Archive (NaNDA), we have county-level crime rate as the outcome variable, socioeconomic status, and urban planning features (school counts, street connectivity, urbanicity, land cover, road system, the number of parks and pollution sites) as predictor variables. All of NaNDA datasets we use are available on Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). We use regularized regression models including ridge and LASSO regression, tree-based models for model building and compare the predicted crime number with the actual crime number in the United States.

## Data Retrieval

To make our analysis reproducible, we use the function `icpsr_download` to download data. The downloaded data is stored in a sub-directory called `data`. The process is repeated every time someone tries to run the code.

## Data Cleaning

We limit our modeling data to year 2013. The socioeconomic indicators are from ACS 5-years estimate for 2013 to 2017. The number of parks, street connectivity, urbanicity, road system are form the 2010 decennial
